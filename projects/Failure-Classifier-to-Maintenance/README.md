# Failure Classifier to Maintenance

## Overview
This project focuses on predictive maintenance in industrial settings, specifically classifying types of failures based on sensor data. Using Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and modeling, streamlit to deploy and CRISP-DM for project organization, we aim to enhance machine reliability and reduce downtime through maintenance strategies.

## Objectives
- Classify types of failures using machine learning models.

## Data Source
The analysis utilizes the Predictive Maintenance [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephanmatzka/predictive-maintenance-dataset-ai4i-2020) (AI4I 2020), containing sensor readings and failure information from industrial equipment.

## Project Structure
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Contains data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling, and evaluation using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.
- **CRISP-DM Framework:** Organizes the project into phases: business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment.
- **Streamlit App:** Deploys the trained model for interactive predictions and analysis.
